# YouTube_Sentiment_Analysis

This is an NLP-based project, by giving the YouTube video link, we analyze and segregate the comments of a video into POSITIVE NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL comments.
we used gradio, a Python library, that works on the Django framework to create the User Interface of this project.
